## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started by taking a look at the design and figure out which layout I should pick, then making up the HTML structure, importing assets in HTML and CSS (custom variables), then I have styled it from top to bottom.

Finally, I added the JavaScript code required for user interaction.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript
